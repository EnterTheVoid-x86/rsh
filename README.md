A simple shell written in Ruby because why not!


I'm kind of new to programing, and did this entire shell within 6 hours. Enjoy!

Credits to Stargirl-chan on GitHub for the original Ruby-Shell. This is an unofficial v1.2 build of it with many added feautres and more. Go check them out, they make awesome stuff, such as cool-tty!

## Q&A

**Why?**
Because why not?

**Can I use this as my main shell?**
Are you a masochist?

**Are you planing on continuing this project?**
If I have freetime, and the will to do so, then yes, if not, then no.

**Who asked these questions?**
No one. Literally.

**How did you write this?**
These two sites helped me creating it:
[Writing a shell in 25 Lines of Ruby](https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/07/writing-a-shell-in-ruby/) and 
[A Unix shell in Ruby](https://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766107-a-unix-shell-in-ruby)
